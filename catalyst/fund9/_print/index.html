In particular, the shortage of development funds and engineers is serious, and students have few opportunities to get these resources. However, Catalysts are easier to raise money than VCs(Venture Capital) and Business Contests, and also can connect globally with engineers in this community. However, the number of proposals to Catalysts is increasing rapidly, and the community does not easily notice small-scale proposals from students. In addition, it is difficult to set a clear Roadmap while resources are scarce and to get a high evaluation from CA(Community Advisor).</p><p>Therefore, to make it easier for the community to recognize new ideas from students, we will establish a new Category exclusively for students. In addition, instead of the roadmap being ambiguous, we set a budget limit of $ 5,000. By doing so, many students can experience funding from Catalyst. In continued participation in Catalyst, funding experience, even on a small scale, is evaluated by the community. Therefore, it is important to set a budget limit.</p><p>The Category Goal is to encourage engineers to scout students who are evaluated by the community and create a new team to join the next Fund with a clear Roadmap. This is a benefit for both students and engineers to raise a large salary for engineers through Catalyst rather than from VCs or Banks.</p><h3 id=why-is-it-important>Why is it important?</h3><p>Most student entrepreneurs are suffering from resource shortages, especially in funding and engineer recruitment.</p><h3 id=what-does-success-look-like>What does success look like?</h3><p>By setting up a student category and increasing the exposure of their ideas, they can expect easier funding and scouted from engineers.</p><h3 id=key-metrics-to-measure>Key Metrics to measure</h3><ul><li>Number of proposals for this category</li><li>Number of applause and comments from the community</li><li>Number of proposals that could be collaborated with other engineers</li><li>Number of proposals that participated in the next fund</li></ul></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-7f855e3354ca8d4c62f2d4c88c88f453>1.3 - Cross-Chain Collaboration</h1><div class=lead>In the next 6-12 months, how might we create new connections between blockchain communities and how do we enhance existing collaboration?</div><img src=https://cardano.ideascale.com/community-library/accounts/93/936143/Public/03-Cross-Chain-Collaboration-fc4ff5.png style=width:500px;height500px><p>Fund Size: <strong>900,000 USD paid in Ada</strong></p><p><a href=https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/campaigns/26598/about>Campaign page</a></p><h2 id=challenge-brief>Challenge Brief</h2><h4 id=background>Background</h4><p>Why is this Challenge needed?</p><ul><li>Tribalism & maximalism are harmful.</li><li>We are in the multi-chain future.</li><li>Interoperability is the key.</li><li>We need initiatives to increase communication, coordination and collaboration between chains.</li><li>We have common challenges.

In this challenge, we provide funding for people who have learned about Cardano to take advantage of the community&rsquo;s support and build on or use the Cardano network.</p><p>The nature of the proposals for this challenge is open-ended. Their only requirement is to originate or focus on East Asia and include east Asian team members or focus on East Asian participants.</p><p>For instance, the overwhelming majority of Stake Pools reside in North America and Europe. The Cardano network will be more resilient when Stake Pools are evenly distributed across the globe. The Catalyst community needs to step up and intentionally make that happen.</p><p>Cardano started life in East Asia (Japan and Hong Kong), and Emurgo focuses on East Asia. Let&rsquo;s build upon that.</p><h4 id=what-this-is>What this is:</h4><p><strong>A call to action;</strong> Activate the Cardano community&rsquo;s ability to recognise, reward the opportunity to make the world a better place. East Asia is fertile ground for the adoption of Cardano. The return on intention (ROI) is likely to be high because projects in young and developing economies face less economic inertia.</p><p>Addressing different parts of the world directly and intentionally through funding challenges makes our community more accessible. It makes us more resilient. It helps us learn and understand the needs of communities that make up our ecosystem.</p><p>It is a vision that needs votes to become an achievement. When the challenge succeeds, the beneficiary is the whole Cardano community. It is a call to close our prejudices and open our eyes, hearts and minds to good people who lack the benefits many of us were born with—allowing others with fewer privileged circumstances to rise and succeed.</p><h3 id=why-is-it-important>Why is it important?</h3><p>The Cardano community leans heavily toward North America and Europe.

Additionally, projects that are better suited for the account-style method (instead of UTXO) also exist, and we want these projects to be usable from the Cardano ecosystem as well.</p><p>To accomplish this part of the roadmap, many efforts are currently underway such as KEVM, IELE, ERC20 Converter and Milkomeda to name a few. These projects are reaching the point where they are mature enough for people to deploy using them or build tooling for them and so it&rsquo;s time to start welcoming projects to Cardano.</p><p>You can hear Charles talk about the importance of this in his video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8a6tX53YPs">The Island, The Ocean and the Pond</a></p><h3 id=why-is-it-important>Why is it important?</h3><p>Many projects are stuck on EVM-based blockchains like Ethereum and are looking for an escape.
